# Polkadot Live

Decentralised Polkadot Notifications and Chain Interactions on the Desktop.

## Testing

Follow the steps below to run the WebdriverIO test suite:

1. Install Chrome Driver on your system. For Mac OS:

   ```
   brew install chromedriver
   ```

  **Note:** You may need to allow the `chromedriver` program to run on Mac OS
  via the system preferences Privacy & Security settings.

2. Package dependencies as of WebdriverIO version 8:

   ```
   yarn add --dev expect expect-webdriverio @types/mocha @wdio/globals @wdio/mocha-framework
   ```

   Add following to `tsconfig.json`:

   ```
   {
      "compilerOptions": {
         "types": ["node", "@wdio/globals/types", "@wdio/mocha-framework"]
      }
   }
   ```

2. Build the app by invoking the `package:dev` script, which bundles
  `devDepencies` with the app needed for running the WebdriverIO test runner:

   ```
   yarn run package:dev
   ```

3. Invoke the `wdio` script to run the entire WDIO test suite:

   ```
   yarn run wdio
   ```
